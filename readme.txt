The plugin adds links to bloggers posts for readers to contact them without scripts or work-a-rounds like my email is john (at) doe.com.

== Description ==

The plugin gives bloggers a easy way to provide a link for readers to contact them without using scripts or work arounds such john(at)doe.com.

Using this plugin will allow direct communication bewteen the writer and the readers without exposing the writers email address to spammers or spam bots.

The plugin appends a link at the end of all the bloggers posts. This link is to the bloggers Yougler Profile page where readers can read a little bit about the blogger or blog and send mail-forwarded email. This keeps the blogger from getting spam while allowing the writer and readers to communicate easily.

In order to use the Yougler Profile you must first set up an account at Yougler.com. It is quick, easy, and free.

After that, login to your WordPress blog, go under the Users tab and set your website address to your Yougler address. For example if your Yougler username were john, enter 'http://www.yougler.com/john'.

The Yougler Plugin will now create a link to your Yougler Profile page at the end of all your posts. The link name will be your Display name publicly as: setting under the Users tab in WordPress.
